# Snow-crash
---

### üîê Project Overview

- **Format**: The project is delivered as a downloadable ISO file. We need to run it in a virtual machine after installation.
- **Levels**: There are **levels 00‚Äì09** (with **levels 10‚Äì14** as bonus). Each level corresponds to a user account (e.g., `level00`, `level01`, etc.).
- **Tools & Techniques**: Participants engage with a variety of tools and techniques, including:
    - Reverse engineering
    - Assembly language analysis
    - Buffer overflow exploitation
    - Format string vulnerabilities
    - Privilege escalation
    - Network traffic analysis
    - Scripting with Bash, Perl, and PHP

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To embark on the Snow Crash project:

1. **Download the ISO**: Obtain the Snow Crash ISO file from 42‚Äôs internal resources.
2. **Set Up a Virtual Machine**: Use VirtualBox or VMware to create a new virtual machine.
3. **Configure Network Settings**:
    - Go to `Settings ‚Üí Expert ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Port Forwarding`
    - Change the **Host IP** to use a **Host-only Adapter** for SSH access.
4. **Boot the VM**: Start the virtual machine.
5. **Log In via SSH**:
    
    ```bash
    ssh level00@[VM_IP_ADDRESS] -p 424
    ```
    
    - **Initial password**: `level00`
6. **Begin the Challenge**: Analyze and exploit the vulnerabilities to find the next level‚Äôs password.

### üìò Summary

- Each level contains a **unique security flaw**.
- Your goal is to **find and exploit** that flaw to obtain the **next user‚Äôs password**.
- Once obtained, switch to the next level:
    
    ```bash
    su levelXX
    ```
    
    Use the password/token you retrieved.
    
- After switching users, run:
    
    ```bash
    getflag
    ```
    
    This command reveals the **flag/token** for your summary or report.
    
- Repeat this process for each level until completion.
